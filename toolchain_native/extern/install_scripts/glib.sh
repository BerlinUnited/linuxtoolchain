  # patch glib2 so that the macros `major' and `minor' are defined if newer glibc versions are used to compile this version of glib2
  # gio/gdbusmessage.c requires two macros `major' and `minor'. These macros are defined in sys/sysmacros.h of glibc.
  # In glib-2.26 it is assumed that sys/sysmacros.h is indirectly included thru including sys/types.h into gio/gdbusmessage.c.
  # Beginning with glibc 2.25 indirect inclusion is deprecated and is only done if the macro __USE_MISC is defined.
  # Since glibc 2.28 sys/sysmacros.h can't be indirectly included thru sys/types.h anymore.
  # So to be able to compile glib-2.26 on modern linux systems gio/gdbusmessage.c need to include sys/sysmacros.h directly.
